The trajectory details an extensive, iterative development process for an OG-themed e-commerce platform. The AI engineer initiated the project by resolving repository cloning issues and then focused on incrementally implementing features and addressing bugs. A recurring pattern emerged where the AI frequently declared features production-ready after fixes, only for the user to report immediate regressions or new, critical issues. Initial challenges included persistent UI/UX bugs, such as image display, inconsistent badge displays, and navigation.

Key feature implementations included a VAULT, LOCKED EXCLUSIVE product tier, full NFT integration, dynamic navigation with crazy names, comprehensive discount pricing, and a robust Shopify integration for customer accounts, ranks, and loyalty. The AI rebuilt the cart as a dedicated page and introduced various conversion boosters and animations. Most recently, the user reported severe mobile responsiveness problems, broken mobile cart, missing homepage badges, and continued spinning up servers errors, indicating a lack of overall UI polish and robustness, particularly on mobile. The AI's last action was acknowledging these fundamental UI/UX and mobile issues.

The product is an OG-themed e-commerce platform, aiming for high performance and brutal typography. It requires full Shopify Storefront/Admin API integration for products, collections, cart, and metafields. Key features include India-first UX (UPI/COD), automated Shopify product uploads, and fan-first elements like rank-based drops. Specific page redesigns were needed for homepage, shop (Armory), and product detail pages (PDPs).

Explicit user requests evolved: fixing under999 badge display, correcting image display (back default, front hover), functional navigation, implementing a VAULT, LOCKED EXCLUSIVE tier, and easy NFT integration with blockchain linking for images. The user also demanded crazy, exciting names for navigation/tabs, chopped discount pricing, and a comprehensive Shopify CMS integration for customer accounts, rank system, loyalty points, and vault access logic. A list of 12 practical moves was provided, encompassing an UNDER ₹999 rail, a minimal trust strip, UPI/COD/WhatsApp buy buttons, scarcity pills, product stories, localized hero text, a Vault mini-section, UGC strip, Ranks in header, bundle nudges, and a counterfeit report link. Recently, an overhaul to a full cart page with suggestions was requested, along with fixing product card layout (button size, title spacing, badge positioning), implementing animations, making the Battle Elite badge clickable, and critically, addressing persistent issues with ugly cards, lack of premium feel, broken mobile cart, missing homepage badges, spinning up servers errors, and overall mobile responsiveness.
